# Full Stack Blog MicroService App 

## Made using NodesJS, ExpressJS, ReactJS

#### Here, I have used two methods for inter-service communication:
    - Synchronus Communication
        - Quite easy to implement and easy to understand as well but has quite of some major down sides
    - Asynchronus Communication
        - Complex to understand and implement but has huge advantages over Sync Comms
        - For this, I'll build "Event Bus" or "Event Broker" from scratch
